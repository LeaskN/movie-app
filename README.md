## In this project I am refraining from using any libraries as I want to keep this lightweight and simple

## User Stories:
* As a User I should be able to list the most popular movies titles based on average ratings
* As a User I should see the results as a list. One title per row
* As a User I should be able to see for each movie title the following details:
    * Title Name
    * Release Year
    * Film Rating (PG, PG-13, R, etc..)
    * Runtime
    * Genre(s)
    * Poster Artwork
    * Average Rating (8/10, 10/10, etcâ€¦)
* As a user I should be able to adjust the time range with a simple filter
* As a user I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear
